If you were hosting a technical event, what steps would you take to increase awareness about your event and attract the targeted audience?

=>An effective team will be required, who are able to handle their responsibilities in the team.
By increasing its awareness on social media platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram, Linked In, etc. through posters and pamphlets.
By making a group and joining interested candidates that will further join other interested students.
By creating a database of all the interested students through an online registration forms, send them important updates through the mail, SMS, and other platforms.
By involving the right faculty of college can increase the participation of students in campus events.
Telling them the pros and cons of these events and how you will be affected if you don't join this event. Showing them related videos about campus events. By giving some exciting prizes to winners, participation certificate to all the students and discounts on team participation in events.









ANSER=>So here is how I approach the problem:
Use what you know about the person to demonstrate how the concept is useful/interesting for them: it could be a gain in productivity (e.g I often help analysts automate their scripts), it could be how to access the database that holds the data to answer the burning question they asked at the last meeting … tie it to their experience, their domain of knowledge
Demonstrate it live, even better if you can do it within their context. Hide the complexity of it! Complexity often means lots of details and those drag people out of the main focus into how hard it will be to learn and/or use. You want to promote learning-by-doing, if you get them to start devoting time to use this concept or tool, they will be looking for the details (and learn in the process)
Have a couple of resources ready for them to get started? Again, simplicity helps, look for tutorials, blog posts, documentation “QuickStart” sections. How can they reproduce what you demonstrated and take it from there when you’re not next to them?
Finally, be available for questions and further support.
