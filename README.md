If you were hosting a technical event, what steps would you take to increase awareness about your event and attract the targeted audience?

ANSER=>So here is how I approach the problem:
Use what you know about the person to demonstrate how the concept is useful/interesting for them: it could be a gain in productivity (e.g I often help analysts automate their scripts), it could be how to access the database that holds the data to answer the burning question they asked at the last meeting … tie it to their experience, their domain of knowledge
Demonstrate it live, even better if you can do it within their context. Hide the complexity of it! Complexity often means lots of details and those drag people out of the main focus into how hard it will be to learn and/or use. You want to promote learning-by-doing, if you get them to start devoting time to use this concept or tool, they will be looking for the details (and learn in the process)
Have a couple of resources ready for them to get started? Again, simplicity helps, look for tutorials, blog posts, documentation “QuickStart” sections. How can they reproduce what you demonstrated and take it from there when you’re not next to them?
Finally, be available for questions and further support.
